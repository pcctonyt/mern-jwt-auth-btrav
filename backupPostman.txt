This is the Postman setup when I got the jwt token part to work at 39:13 done on the second video

First Tab
GET request
http://localhost:5000/api/goals
No key/values being sent in the body

Second Tab
POST request
http://localhost:5000/api/users
key/value pairs in the body:
name:  Jane Doe
email: jane@gmail.com
password: 123456
didn't have the token key yet

Third Tab
POST request
http://localhost:5000/api/users/login
key/value pairs in the body:
email: john@gmail.com
password: 123456

the token key appears in the response object
the token is not set in the body under the Auth menu


Fourth Tab
GET request
http://localhost:5000/api/users/me?
no key/value pairs in the body

the Auth is set to bearer token and we copy that in from the third tab after we click send

returns "Display user data" in the json object
